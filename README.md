In this repository, I will be uploading small to large projects and scripts that I work on in Python.

Everything you find here is completely free to use.

**Projects:**

1. [Calculator](https://github.com/dgcosenza/Python/tree/main/Calculator)
2. [Crypto Prices](https://github.com/dgcosenza/Python/tree/main/Crypto_prices)
